# expunge-pdx-frontend
This is a prototype and design system where we can build the frontend views (HTML/CSS) before integrating with the main app (it's in a [separate repository](https://github.com/CodeForPortland/recordexpungPDX)). We have this separate repository because it's quicker than getting the full local environment running.
